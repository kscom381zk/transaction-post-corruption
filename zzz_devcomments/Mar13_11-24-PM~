Somehow, I managed to corrupt my git installation, not the repository itself (which would have been easier to manage, since there are way more search results on that matter). I created a new repository, and a new directory (locally) in which to modify the project.

I know that I was supposed to be commiting all the time, every time, and I love the passion of that. I know how hard it is to understand other people's code. But I think you'll find that, as a first project, this is a pretty lacking thing. 95% of this is a scaffold generate, and I don't think I even met the guidelines in the project specifications. There is little outstanding in this project of mine.
